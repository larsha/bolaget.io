# Contributing

## We all love pull requests. Here's a quick guide:

1. [Fork the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and create a branch
for your new feature or bug fix.

2. Setup development environment, check out the [README](README.md) for more info.

3. Add at least one test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes
require no new tests. Also make sure you submit a change specific to exactly one issue. If you have ideas for multiple
changes please create separate pull requests.

4. Make the test(s) pass. We only accept pull requests with passing tests.

5. Commit (write a good commit message) and push to your fork.

6. [Submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). A button should
appear on your fork.

At this point you're waiting on us. We may suggest some changes, improvements or alternatives.
